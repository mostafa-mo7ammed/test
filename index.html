        <p class="topic-title">What's the difference between UX and UI?</p>
        <p class="topic-describe">The difference between UX and UI is the same as the difference between interface and experience. Interface refers to all of the aspects of a product or service that users interact with. Experience, on the other hand, is defined by the kind of interaction users have with those products or services and how they feel about them.
          <br>
          Put simply, UX is the why of a product, and UI is the how.</p>

        <p class="topic-title">What is a Static Website?</p>
        <p class="topic-describe">
          A static website uses server-side rendering to serve pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web browser, in contrast to traditional dynamic sites that work by rendering the webpage at the time of the request.
          <br><br>
          Static sites enable you to decouple your content repository and front-end interface, giving you greater flexibility in how your content is served. Cost-efficiency is another reason companies migrate to a static site because static files are lightweight and often faster and cheaper to serve.
          <br><br>
          In the last few years, static sites have greatly increased in popularity. This surge is primarily due to advances in developer tools (languages and libraries) and a stronger desire among businesses to optimize website performance beyond the limits of a database-driven site. Below, we’ll discuss the benefits of a static site in greater detail.

        <p class="topic-title"> What's Important of posters ?</p>
        <p class="topic-describe">Advertising posters are used by small businesses. A poster has a visual design, images, and copy. It provides a message intended to promote brand awareness or call attention. A poster has many advantages.
        <br><br>
        Posters are printed in various shapes and sizes. A letter-sized poster allows sending the poster as a mailer, or fit it on bulletin boards. For greater visual impact and design flexibility, a large poster size with an impressive colour scheme has a better chance to grab attention.
        <br><br>
        Posters allow for flexible distribution or placement. Companies have specific bulletin areas for public postings. Promote events by putting up posters, gain the potential for repeat exposures and improved brand recognition in secure and visible spots.
        <br><br>
        Advertising posters are affordable with a high return on investment – more than newspaper and magazine ads. With a team of interns or hourly workers, the distribution cost is less. Compare the costs and the longevity of the message to the price for a small box ad in a newspaper, the value becomes clear.

          What's important of Logo?
        </p>
        <p class="topic-describe">
          A logo is an abbreviated mark that defines your business in its totality – the mission, what you do, and how you conduct your business. It is often the first impression people get and needs to be unique enough to be recognizable. Your logo and how you’ll carry that through the rest of your brand identity should be one of the biggest things that you put a lot of thought and care into. Brand identity is all of the components of your branding (logo, tone, tagline, design elements, type used, etc) working together to portray the overall image of your business.
          <br><br>
          The styling of your logo also speaks a lot to the type of business you are. The two most common types of logos are an icon image with the name of your business, or just a text-based logo. A simple typeface (aka font family) change throughout your branding can change the personality of your business from a fun, casual business to a stiff, professional business that cares about rigid rules and regulations you comply with.
